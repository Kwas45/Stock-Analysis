# **STOCK ANALYSIS - EXCEL VBA**



## **OVERVIEW**


###### **_PURPOSE_**

The purpose of this project is to refactor the original code, which was used to analyze green energy stock data relative to new energy corporation stock in 2017 and 2018. This was to assess if investing in the new energy corporation stock is profitable. The refactoring seeks to loop through all the data one time to evaluate the efficiency of the code.   


### **STOCK PERFORMANCE**

Based on the data above, DQ had the highest return in 2017 and RUN in 2018. TERP had the lowest return in 2017 and DQ in 2018. DQ has been the most volatile stock.  
Stocks generally performed better in 2017 compared to 2018.  
TERP stock had negative returns in both 2017 and 2018, however 2018 was better by 2.2%. 
ENPH and RUN were the only stocks to have positive returns for 2017 and 2018 with ENPH having a 47.1% decrease in 2018. RUN had the highest return increase from 2017 to 2018 of about 78.5%. 
ENPH has been the most stable stock.   


#### ****_EXECUTION TIMES_****

We can deduce from the above images that the refactored code had a significant decrease in run time. Refactoring renders the code effective by editing the initial code to make it easier for future users via loops, formats, adding comments, and rewriting inundated codes. 

When not done right, refactoring could alter the outcome achieved by the original code. Troubleshooting may take a while if the necessary steps werenâ€™t taken to safeguard the original code.
